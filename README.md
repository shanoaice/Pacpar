> :construction: This is a work in progress.

Pacpar is a feature-rich pacman wrapper (libalpm frontend) written in C#, supporting querying and building AUR or external PKGBUILDs and parallel Xfercommand downloads.

[Pacpar.Alpm](./src/Pacpar.Alpm/README.md) is a C# FFI wrapper library for libalpm, also hosted in this repository.
